# LungKinematics
A set of tools and analysis pipelines for lung and lobar kinematics.

CURRENT TASK:
Implement the "Natural HHD" algorithm from Bhatia et al. 2014.

SUB TASKS:
	- Implement Natural HHD function (NaturalHHD.m) [ ]
	- Compare Natural HHD to BC HHD on planar vector field examples [ ]

STRUCTURAL CHANGES:


What's required to make this more "independent"?
- Address External Dependencies
	- TecPlot Tools folder
	- Loading data

- Add missing analyses
	- FE simulation deformation analyses
	- Sliding trajectory analysis
