# LungKinematics
A set of tools and analysis pipelines for lung and lobar kinematics.

Current analysis include:
- Mapping sliding trajectories of lung simulations (Test_SlidingTrajectory.m)
- Analyzing the distortion inside the lung lobes during a breathing maneuver (AnalyzeADI.m)
- Using Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition to quantitatively characterize sliding motion in the lungs (Test_HelmholtzHodgeDecomp.m)

All work done as part of the Raghavan BioMOST lab. Check us out at: https://biomost.engineering.uiowa.edu/
