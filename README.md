# LungKinematics
A set of tools and analysis pipelines for lung and lobar kinematics.

CURRENT TASK:
Implement a "View HHD Components" function to make some of the analyses more compact.


SUB TASKS:
- Implement the ViewHHDComponents.m
  - Code the function [X]
  - Incoproate into analysis functions [X]
    - Halfplane_HodgeDecomp.m [X]
    - Test_HHD_SimpleLobeTransformations [X]
    - Test_HelmholtzHodgeDecomp [X]

STRUCTURAL CHANGES:
- 

What's required to make this more "independent"?
- Address External Dependencies
	- TecPlot Tools folder
	- Loading data

- Add missing analyses
	- FE simulation deformation analyses
	- Sliding trajectory analysis
